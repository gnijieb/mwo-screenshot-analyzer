Warning
Only 1920x1200 resolution supported at the moment
The script is still pretty rough (code), though works surprisingly well (analyzed ~240 games -> matched my manually entered data almost perfectly)

Requirements
- Linux or Cygwin (looking to make it runnable in Windows)
- Python 2.7
- Tesseract
- Python modules: python-Levenshtein, pytesseract
- You need screenshots of both the player and team stats (end of round) in a specific order:
	- first: teamstats
	- second: playerstats

Usage
- clone repo
- create directories: input, output, intermediate, processed
- search in analyze.py for "CONFIG" parameters
- set CONFIG.playername to the playername you want to analyze (obviously it will work only with your name)
- set CONFIG.resinfo (resolution information of locations of the to be extracted data, currently only available for 1920x1200 resolution; extendable)
- set CONFIG.fnpattern (MWO or FRAPS - this is how the filename of the screenshots is formatted to parse it)
- set CONFIG.dtformat (MWO or FRAPS - this is how the datetime gets parsed from the filename of the screenshots)
- place your screenshots in input directory
- run analyze.py
- if something is not recognized correctly or as expected, you are asked to open the image in input folder and enter the desired value
- processed screenshots are moved to the processed folder
- the result is in form of CSV in: output/data.csv
