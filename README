Usage
- You need screenshots of both the player and team stats (end of round) in a specific order (don't mix):
	- first: teamstats, second: playerstats
	- first: playerstats, second: teamstats
- place your screenshots in input directory
- Open a Command Prompt (cmd.exe)
- Change directory to the location of mwo-screenshot-analyzer
	- e.g.: "cd C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\mwo-screenshot-analyzer"
- Example with screenshots created with FRAPS (player stats first, team stats second)
	- run: "python analyze.py -p "PLAYERNAME" -t fraps -m3"
	- run: "python analyze.py --help" to see available arguments/usage
- if something is not recognized correctly or as expected, you are asked to open the image in input folder and enter the desired value or select from a given list of best matches
- processed screenshots are moved to the processed folder
- the result is in form of CSV in: output/2016-05-01 20-56-49_data.csv

Optional: External Processing
You can create your own external processing module to e.g. submit the data to a database or save it in a specific format.
